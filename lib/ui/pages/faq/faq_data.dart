    answer: [

      ),
      FaqTextLine(
        "The primary factor in determining team performance is the point spread of each game. Unlike traditional point spreads, in our game, the point spread is only set once for each team at the start of each game day.",
      ),
      FaqTextLine(
        "A team's share value increases if it beats the point spread and decreases if it does not. This means a team's value can rise even if it loses a game, or fall even if it wins, depending solely on its performance relative to the point spread.",

        "The team that beats the point spread will see an increase in value, whereas the team that does not will see a decrease.",
      ),
      FaqTextLine(
        "The extent to which a team beats or fails to meet the point spread determines the magnitude of their value change. Covering the spread by a larger margin results in greater increases in value, and failing by a wider margin leads to corresponding decreases.",
      ),
      FaqTextLine(
        "It's important to note here that the algorithm is weighted in the sense that the first few points above or below the point spread will have a greater impact on share values than any additional points. This is to prevent teams from having their share values skyrocket or plummet after a single game.",
      ),
      FaqTextLine(
        "Additionally, the calculation includes a 'round factor', which escalates with each tournament round, making share value fluctuations more significant as the tournament progresses.",
